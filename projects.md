## ToolSense IoT based Smart Workshop Management System
**Reasoning:** Final Project for IoT Class  
**Technologies:** 
- ESP32
- ESP32-Cam
- Raspberry Pi
- C
- React.js
- Python
- **Azure IoT Hub**

**Description:**  
ToolSense is a smart workshop management system that tracks the live status of toolboxes and their contents. It combines sensors and modules to recognize faces from a registered group of users and track tools as they are taken or returned. The system maintains a live feed of toolbox status for administrators via a web application. ToolSense was built using **Internet of Things strategies and resources**.

**What I demonstrated:**
- **Embedded Systems Design:** Implemented multiple embedded system features including facial detection and encoding, integration of hardware sensors, and system-to-system Wi-Fi communication.  

- **IoT Cloud Integration:** Leveraged **Azure IoT Hub** for real-time telemetry storage and monitoring.  

- **Scripting and Backend Development:** Used Python, C#, and React.js to instantaneously send and collect data from the cloud for use in the user interface.
